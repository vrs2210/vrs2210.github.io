I'm Khaelis *(@vrs2210)*, I've lived in Denmark ever since I was born, and know both Danish and English fluently.
I'm not a talkative nor social - better known as 'shy' - person, I've lived most of my life on the internet due to my father granting me internet access at a young age, I do not rectify for giving kids at young ages access to the internet, but it helped rather than cripple me, as I am not only smarter but also more observant because of said choice, to which day I thank him for.
I've been on Roblox since 2011, whereas I created my [account](https://www.roblox.com/users/32327164/profile) in 2012, leading to 2015, when I finally began developing via Roblox Studio.
Over the years, I've learned from looking at free models and blogs on the internet, to the point I do not need the [documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs).
My everlasting obsession with developing is within optimization and changing what already exists. I have a habit of squeezing out as much optimization whilst still making my code as readable/customizable as possible.

My times are pretty flexible, as of current *(30/01/2026)*, I am unemployed and not in education *(NEET)*, therefore I have a lot of free time to develop or to help others via commissions.

My rates are per-project; I do not take about half payments at the start and end of projects. I take the full amount at the end.
My preferred payment type is via PayPal; I do not have any other globally available transaction system.

Have a great day!
