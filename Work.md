# Own Projects
I've ordered my work into individual years and projects.
## 2026
### Arcane Adventures Spin-off [ONGOING]
I've read through the Arcane Adventures Webtoon and was really interested in the storytelling. I wasn't around when Arcane Adventures was an active game. I am looking to  the Webtoon for content rather than videos of the game.
The spin-off will be inspired mainly by the webtoon; some story elements might even incorporate some of its lore, but it will have its own story and self-made mechanics.
I am so far alone on this project, and have not created a map as of yet.
#### Experiment for the style of building.

#### Base magic circles and curse cubes.

## 2025
### Nuevo Paraíso [ABANDONED]
Sandbox-esque about testing wild-western weaponry with enhanced replication and graphical fidelity.
No images are provided, as there is nothing major.
# Was a Developer at
## Dragon Ball Reborn Roleplay
It is currently still active at (Game)[https://www.roblox.com/games/513255899/Dragon-Ball-Reborn-Roleplay]. The game is what it says in the game name: it's a roleplay about the Dragon Ball series with customization, transformations, and a map to explore.
I was the co-head for a majority of its lifetime, my updates granting the game tenfold more FPS and smoothness when it came to transformations and other slight aspects of the game, eventually leading it to surpass 1 million visits.
However, as tensions drew tight and the head of the game became riddled with greed, he eventually kicked me off the developer team and permanently banned me, leading shortly to the game's decline into inactivity.
